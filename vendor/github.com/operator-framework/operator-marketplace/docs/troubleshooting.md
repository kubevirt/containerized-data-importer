# Troubleshooting Marketplace Operator

This document lists out some common failures related to the Marketplace Operator a user might encounter, along with ways to troubleshoot the failures. If you encouter a failure related to the Marketplace Operator that is not listed in this document, but should be, please open an issue or a PR to have the failure appended to this document. 

The troubleshooting steps listed here are for Marketplace resources like OperatorSource and CatalogSourceConfig. To troubleshoot [Operator-lifecycle-manager(OLM)](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) defined resources like ClusterServiceVersion, InstallPlan, Subscription etc, refer to the [OLM troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/Documentation/design/debugging.md).

Note that all examples in this doc are are meant to be ran against an OpenShift cluster. All examples (except for the ones involving the UI) should work with `kubectl` and with the appropriate namespaces substituted in them.

## No packages show up in the UI (No OperatorHub Items Found)

When you install an OpenShift cluster, OperatorHub comes with a default list of operators that can be installed onto the cluster. A number of resources need to be investigated if however you see a message like this: 

![Operator Hub Error Image](images/OperatorHubError.png)


First, investigate the OperatorSources. 

```
$ oc get opsrc -n openshift-marketplace

NAME                  TYPE          ENDPOINT              REGISTRY              DISPLAYNAME           PUBLISHER   STATUS      MESSAGE                                       AGE
certified-operators   appregistry   https://quay.io/cnr   certified-operators   Certified Operators   Red Hat     Succeeded   The object has been successfully reconciled   22h
community-operators   appregistry   https://quay.io/cnr   community-operators   Community Operators   Red Hat     Succeeded   The object has been successfully reconciled   22h
redhat-operators      appregistry   https://quay.io/cnr   redhat-operators      Red Hat Operators     Red Hat     Succeeded   The object has been successfully reconciled   22h
```

If the status of any of the OperatorSource is anything other than `Succeeded`, you can investigate the OperatorSource with 
`oc describe opsrc <Name-of-OperatorSource> -n openshift-marketplace`. [This section](#operatorSource-failing-to-connect-to-the-datastore) and [the following section](#operators-in-an-operatorsource-fail-to-show-up-in-the-ui) of the doc also contains helpful information about debugging an OperatorSource. 

If the OperatorSources look healthy, make sure that there's a pod corresponding to each OperatorSource and that they are in the `Running` state.

```
$ oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace

NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
certified-operators-79f876c76d-mbtjg    1/1       Running   0          86m
community-operators-854c564f5f-9vk2x    1/1       Running   0          86m
marketplace-operator-6dcd66cb8c-2wmkz   1/1       Running   0          86m
redhat-operators-647fd668fc-9ff5d       1/1       Running   0          86m

```

If any pod is in a state other than `Running` inspect the logs of the pod with `oc logs <Name-of-Pod>`.

If all pods look healthy, make sure that there's a CatalogSource for each corresponding CatalogSourceConfigs.

```
$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace 

NAME                  NAME                  TYPE      PUBLISHER   AGE
certified-operators   Certified Operators   grpc      Red Hat     23h
community-operators   Community Operators   grpc      Red Hat     23h
redhat-operators      Red Hat Operators     grpc      Red Hat     23h

```
If you need help debugging the CatalogSources, see [Where to go for help](#where-to-go-for-help). 

Next, make sure that the `packagemanifests` were created by the `OLM package-server`. 

```
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace

NAME                             CATALOG               AGE
planetscale-certified            Certified Operators   40h
robin-operator                   Certified Operators   40h
storageos                        Certified Operators   40h
synopsys-certified               Certified Operators   40h
amq-streams                      Red Hat Operators     40h
codeready-workspaces             Red Hat Operators     40h
camel-k                          Community Operators   40h
cluster-logging                  Community Operators   40h
cockroachdb                      Community Operators   40h
descheduler                      Community Operators   40h
```

If no `packagemanifests` were created, check the logs for the `package-server` pods.

```
$ oc get pods -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager -l app=packageserver

NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
packageserver-6c664f6d76-jj24b      1/1       Running   0          3h54m
packageserver-6c664f6d76-kzpd9      1/1       Running   0          3h53m

$ oc logs packageserver-6c664f6d76-jj24b -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager
$ oc logs packageserver-6c664f6d76-kzpd9 -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager

```

The logs for the `package-server` pods should contain information about why it might have failed to detect the presence of the `CatalogSources`. If the `package-server` pod does not show up or is crashing (anything other than healthy), try killing the pod or editing the deployment you see when you `oc get deployments -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager`.

If everything seems healthy, and still no packages show up in the UI, it could be a browser issue. Check the the browser console to see the logs for possible errors. At any point in the steps above if the error looks too complicated to debug, see [Where to go for help](#where-to-go-for-help). 



## OperatorSource failing to connect to the datastore

If an OperatorSource fails to reconcile for any reason, first inspect the `STATUS` and the `MESSAGE` of the OperatorSource with `oc get opsrc -n openshift-marketplace`. You can also inspect the log messages of the marketplace-operator with `oc logs <name-of-marketplace-operator> -n openshift-marketplace` for detailed information about the OperatorSource. 

A common reason for an OperatorSource to not reconcile correctly is the use of the wrong [endpoint](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/examples/community.operatorsource.cr.yaml#L8). Please make sure that the endpoint is specified as `https://quay.io/cnr`.

If quay.io is unavailable, the `MESSAGE` will usually read `unknown error (status 404)`. If the steps listed in this section do not help debug the problem, please reach out to one of the forums listed in [Where to go for help](#where-to-go-for-help).   

## Operator(s) in an OperatorSource fail to show up in the UI

If operators in a particular OperatorSource fail to show up in the UI, it could be because those operators had parsing errors and were ignored by the registry pod. To inspect the corresponding registry pod logs, first identify the name of the registry pod for the OperatorSource with `oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace` (the name of the pod should be of the format `<operator-source-name>-<random-characters>`). Get the logs for the pod with `oc logs <identified-pod-name> -n openshift-marketplace`.

If there are private app-registry repositories in your namespace, not specifying the authenticationToken in the OperatorSource CR will result in them not being listed. Please follow the steps [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/docs/how-to-authenticate-private-repositories.md) for adding the token to the CR.  

## Conflicting Package Names

Package names are global across OperatorSources. To avoid unexpected behavior users should avoid adding any OperatorSources that contain existing packages.

Users can view existing package names with the following command:

```bash
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
```
