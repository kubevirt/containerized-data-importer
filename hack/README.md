### Download CDI

To download the source directly, simply

`$ go get -u kubevirt.io/containerized-data-importer`

### Lint, Test, Build

GnuMake is used to drive a set of scripts that handle linting, testing, compiling, and containerizing.  Executing the scripts directly is not supported at present.

    NOTE: Standard builds require a running Docker daemon!

The standard workflow is performed inside a helper container to normalize the build and test environment for all devs.  Building in the host environment is supported by the Makefile, but is not recommended.

    Docker builds may be disabled by setting DOCKER=0; e.g.
    $ make all DOCKER=0

`$ make all` executes the full workflow.  For granular control of the workflow, several Make targets are defined:

#### Make Targets

- `all`: cleans up previous build artifacts, compiles all CDI packages and builds containers
- `clean`: cleans up previous build artifacts
- `build`: compile all CDI binary artifacts and generate controller manifest
    - `build-controller`: compile cdi-controller binary
    - `build-importer`: compile cdi-importer binary
    - No `build-cloner` target exists as the code is written in bash
- `test`: execute all tests
    - `test-unit`: execute all tests under `./pkg`
    - `test-functional`: execute all tests under `./tests`
- `docker`: compile all binaries and build all containerized
    - `docker-controller`: compile cdi-controller and build cdi-controller image
    - `docker-importer`: compile cdi-importer and build cdi-importer image
    - `docker-cloner`: build the cdi-cloner image (cloner is driven by a shell script, not a binary)
- `manifests`: Generate a cdi-controller manifest in `manifests/generated/`.  Accepts [make variables](#make-variables) DOCKER_TAG, DOCKER_REPO, VERBOSITY, and PULL_POLICY
- `push`: compiles, builds, and pushes to the repo passed in `DOCKER_REPO=<my repo>`
    - `push-controller`: compile, build, and push cdi-controller
    - `push-importer`: compile, build, and push cdi-importer
    - `push-cloner`: compile, build, and push cdi-cloner
- `vet`: lint all CDI packages
- `format`: Execute `shfmt`, `goimports`, and `go vet` on all CDI packages.  Writes back to the source files.
- `publish`: CI ONLY - this recipe is not intended for use by developers
- 'cluster-up': Start a default Kubernetes or Open Shift cluster. set KUBEVIRT_PROVIDER environment variable to either 'k8s-1.10.4' or 'os-3.10.0' to select the type of cluster. set KUBEVIRT_NUM_NODES to something higher than 1 to have more than one node.
- 'cluster-down': Stop the cluster, doing a make cluster-down && make cluster-up will basically restart the cluster into an empty fresh state.
- 'cluster-sync': Builds the controller/importer/cloner, and pushes it into a running cluster. The cluster must be up before running a cluster sync. Also generates a manifest and applies it to the running cluster after pushing the images to it.
- 'functest': Run functional end to end tests against a running cluster. See [execute functional tests](#execute-functional-tests)
#### Make Variables

Several variables are provided to alter the targets of the above `Makefile` recipes.

These may be passed to a target as `$ make VARIABLE=value target`

- `WHAT`:  The path from the repository root to a target directory (e.g. `make test WHAT=pkg/importer`)
- `DOCKER_REPO`: (default: kubevirt) Set repo globally for image and manifest creation
- `DOCKER_TAG`: (default: latest) Set global version tags for image and manifest creation
- `VERBOSITY`: (default: 1) Set global log level verbosity
- `PULL_POLICY`: (default: IfNotPresent) Set global CDI pull policy
- `TEST_ARGS`: A list of arguments passed through `go test -args <test args>`

#### Execute Functional Tests
Environment Variables and Supported Values

| Env Variable       | Default       | Additional Values  |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|
|KUBEVIRT_PROVIDER   | k8s-1.10.4    | os-3.10.0          |
|NUM_NODES           | 1             | 2-5                |

To Run Tests
```
 make cluster-up
 make cluster-sync
 make functest
```

Clean Up
```
 make cluster-down
```

**End to End Functional Tests currently only run on bare-metal - they will not run in a VM/Cloud environment (i.e. GCE, AWS, etc...)**

### Submit PRs

All PRs should originate from forks of kubevirt.io/containerized-data-importer.  Work should not be done directly in the upstream repository.  Open new working branches from master/HEAD of your forked repository and push them to your remote repo.  Then submit PRs of the working branch against the upstream master branch.

### Releases

Release practices are described in the [release doc](/doc/releases.md).

### Vendoring Dependencies

This project uses `glide` as it's dependency manager.  At present, all project dependencies are vendored; using `glide` is unnecessary in the normal work flow.

Install glide:

`curl https://glide.sh/get | sh`

Then run it from the repo root

`glide install -v`

`glide install` scans imports and resolves missing and unused dependencies. `-v` removes nested vendor and Godeps/_workspace directories.

### S3-compatible client setup:

#### AWS S3 cli
$HOME/.aws/credentials
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <your-access-key>
aws_secret_access_key = <your-secret>
```

#### Minio cli

$HOME/.mc/config.json:
```
{
        "version": "8",
        "hosts": {
                "s3": {
                        "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com",
                        "accessKey": "<your-access-key>",
                        "secretKey": "<your-secret>",
                        "api": "S3v4"
                }
        }
}
```
